So, will this year for Bollywood end with good news or not as Raj Batra's quirky comedy is finally out, let's find out!
Good Newwz is the story of an urban well-off couple living in the city of Mumbai, Varun and Deepti Batra (Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor)
who are desperately trying to become parents and fave a family but things don't work out and eventually they decide to
opt for IVF procedure for fulfilling their dream at the best hospital of the city.
But, life has something else in store for them as Varun's sperm gets mixed up by the doctors accidentally with another
couple with the same surname from Chandigarh the loud Punjabis 'Honey and Monica Batra' (Diljit and Kiara Advani) who a
re exactly the opposite of Varun and Deepti which results in the women getting pregnant with the babies of each others' husbands.
This major goof-up ensues a series of chaotic comic situations in the lives of these couples giving you a good dose of
laughter throughout the film. The questions arise what to do now? to keep the baby or not?. What happens next in their l
ives and what these situations lead to is the crux of Raj Mehta's situational comedy.
Director Raj Mehta in his debut Bollywood film has given his best. He uses the talent he has at his disposal to their f
ull potential and makes it clear from the very start that his main motive is to entertain you and give you some good laughs with many light-hearted comic moments.
The screenplay is tight & engaging and full of rib-tickling comic moments especially in the first half as the second
half is more about the emotions and the message the film wants to deliver. The director tries to keep the film's
screenplay as clean as he can but due to the topic, the family audience is bound to feel uncomfortable watching the film at some points but still, it is fun and enjoyable.
Talking about the performances Akshay Kumar is in top form as Varun Batra who does not want the sexual intercourse to
fell like a surgical strike. He is the soul of the film and his comic timing is hilarious.
